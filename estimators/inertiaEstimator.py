#This function implements an estimator to estimate the rotational inertia of the 
#aircraft. This is extremely important as the rotational inertia matrix of the aircraft
#is subject to variability and I would like to have that working to enable the best possible
#feedforward controller that is resiliient to deviations in the matrix
